<!--
	The most important part is to declare your form's enctype to be "multipart/form-data",
	and to have a form:file element that maps to your ActionForm's FormFile property
-->


<html:form action="upload.do" enctype="multipart/form-data">

	Please enter some text, just to demonstrate the handling of text elements as opposed to file elements:<br />
	<html:text property="theText" /><br /><br />

	Please select the file that you would like to upload:<br />
	<html:file property="theFile" /><br /><br />

        If you would rather write this file to another file, please check here:
        <html:checkbox property="writeFile" /><br /><br />

        If you checked the box to write to a file, please specify the file path here:<br />
        <html:text property="filePath" /><br /><br />

	<html:submit />


</html:form>
